### 4.PC Web QR Code SDK(Cooperate With SouthEX)

[SimpleWallet SDK](https://github.com/southex/SimpleWallet/blob/master/README_en.md) for PC Web DApps.

#### Introduction

SimpleWallet is a universal protocol for connecting EOS wallets and dapp.

Currently, there has been rapid development of various wallet applications and dapps in EOS. However, in the actual docking process, the standards of all parties are not unified, and the docking requires much time to complete.

This protocol aims to reduce the development and adaption work of all parties through a low-coupling implementation of a wallet that helps to authorize login and payment of dapp.

This protocol has been built to be compatible with several wallets, and is currently undergoing final tests to ensure their compatibility.
